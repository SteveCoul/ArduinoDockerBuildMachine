# ArduinoDockerBuildMachine
Scripts to install and run a docker based arduino build machine for various targets

Each script here should create a docker container with enough arduino support to compile 
the sketch in the current directory for the given target and leave you with the .bin
file and if required any python script etc. for uploading.
